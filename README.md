# Week 2: Methods and Arrays

## Overview
This project is part of my internship task for Week 2, focusing on implementing Java methods and arrays. The program includes:

- **Factorial Calculator**: Computes the factorial of a given number.
- **Prime Number Checker**: Checks whether a number is prime.
- **Bubble Sort Algorithm**: Sorts an array using Bubble Sort.
- **To-Do List Manager**: Displays a predefined list of tasks.

## Features
✔ Factorial Calculation  
✔ Prime Number Checking  
✔ Sorting (Bubble Sort)  
✔ To-Do List Management  

## Technologies Used
- Java
- VS Code (for development)
- GitHub (for version control)

## How to Run the Program
- **Factorial Calculator**: Open MathematicalProblemSolver.java in your IDE.
- **Prime Number Checker**: Open MathematicalProblemSolver.java in your IDE.
- **Bubble Sort Algorithm**: Open BubbleSort.java in your IDE.
- **To-Do List Manager**: Open ToDoList.java in your IDE.
